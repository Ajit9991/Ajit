        "In this sector, all information stored in the digital format all over the place. This information includes the details of patients in the large amount, which is increasing day by day and that makes complexity to analyze the data if there is a traditional technology. Furthermore, the healthcare sector facing the biggest challenge is provide a quality of service with affordable charges. That's the reason, healthcare domain needs data mining to explore the data and find the pattern to make a decision about patients treatment. Data mining mechanisms are required to analyze the complex data and improve the process of the management and patient. Data mining solve the problem of identifying the disease of the patients and assist with the treatment accordingly and track the disease management (Ogundele, 2018). This management process helps to forecast the time of admission of the patient in clinic, accurate information management system, and prognosis of patients. In addition, it help to reduced a manual work, save lives, secure clinical data, reduce the charge of medical service and early detection of disease (Ionut, 2015). \n",

The purpose of this project is computerized the process of patients profile and their various test report and many more information to find the pattern of disease and their impacts. This automate process help to provide cost-effective treatment to the patients also help to predict the disease. This project gives suggestions to doctor's to make a decision in clinical care and reduce human error. As a result, the health industry will be more organized and will reduced the time of manual work and staff will be more careful to look after the patients.\n",

The predictive analysis includes the various technique to analyze the historical and real-time data to make a forecast. There is a number of health industries which still refers to the traditional methods to maintain the patient log. This project innovation will automate the process for the health sector, it will assist the staff to look after the serious patients and manage everything within the time. Moreover,  system will identify the pattern in disease by using patient data which helps doctor's for treatment also patient data help to discover the knowledge of different disease and their relationship and their causes, it wouldn't be possible without machine learning. This project provide the solution to healthcare sector to identify a new trends, which support's to make decision in health treatment.

After the acquisition of the data, needs to be stored in a clean format which will help to identify the relationship between variables to solve the problems. If we save the data in the .csv file, it will be easier to perform  the data pre-processing operations on a train and test dataset. In this stage, the required operation is data extraction from various sources and transformation of the raw data which is handled by Data Analyst.\n",

We have used the Python tool to perform all analytics operations using several data mining technique. In this process, the data analyst will help to identify the most suitable variables and appropriate constraint to design data model which work very effectively. This model builds to predict the new trend of the disease and give the best possible solution to the treatment on the basis of historical data by using Random Forest. This technique is an ensemble learning method and very effective to accomplish the regression and classification tasks. After applying the regression technique, trained and testing dataset will be ready to predict the treatment solution and the severity of the disease. These outcomes will be stored in .csv format which can easily accessible to management to review. This task handle by the data scientist and software developer.\n",

The main part of the testing is alpha and beta testing. In this context, the product owner has selected different health organisation to check the system functionality are working properly or not. This process called beta testing of the latest version of the project. This software makes available to limited users by providing credentials, so it will be easier for the development team to understand the performance of the system and functionality of the system are working properly with the help of doctors. This process helps to identify the defects to fix as soon as possible. During this process, company needs to make user manual or tutorials to educate the users to use the application. After all the back and forth process software gets ready to deploy. The deployment will be handled by software developer and QA engineer.\n",
